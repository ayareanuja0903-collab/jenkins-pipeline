# 🚀 Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with Docker & Node.js

This project demonstrates a complete **CI/CD pipeline** using Jenkins, Docker, and a Node.js application.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This setup automates the process of:

* Pulling code from GitHub
* Building a Docker image
* Deploying the application in a container
* Running the application on an EC2 server

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Jenkins (CI/CD)
* Docker (Containerization)
* Node.js (Application)
* GitHub (Version Control)
* AWS EC2 (Deployment Server)

---

## ✨ Key Features

* Fully automated CI/CD pipeline
* Dockerized Node.js application
* Automated deployment on AWS EC2
* Continuous deployment on every code push
* Process management using PM2
* Efficient container lifecycle management

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced

* Branch mismatch (master vs main)
* GitHub webhook not triggering
* Docker permission issues (/var/run/docker.sock)
* Port conflicts during deployment

---

## ⚙️ CICD Workflow

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y openjdk-17-jdk docker.io git npm
```

---

### 3️⃣ Start Services

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
```

---

### 4️⃣ Configure Jenkins

* Open Jenkins:

  ```
  http://<EC2-IP>:8080
  ```
* Install suggested plugins
* Create a pipeline job

---

### 5️⃣ Connect GitHub Repository

* Configure pipeline:

  * Pipeline script from SCM
  * SCM: Git
  * Repository URL:

    ```
    https://github.com/your-username/jenkins-pipeline.git
    ```
  * Branch: `main`
  * Script Path: `Jenkinsfile`

---

### 6️⃣ Setup GitHub Webhook

* Go to GitHub → Settings → Webhooks
* Add:

  ```
  http://<EC2-IP>:8080/github-webhook/
  ```
* Content type: `application/json`
* Event: Push

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins
3. Jenkins pulls latest code
4. Docker image is built
5. Old container is removed
6. New container is deployed

---

## ✅ Solutions Implemented

* Updated branch configuration to use main instead of master
* Corrected GitHub webhook URL and trigger settings
* Configured AWS Security Group to allow required ports (8080, 3001)
* Resolved Docker permission issues by adding Jenkins user to Docker group
* Implemented container lifecycle management (stop, remove, redeploy) to avoid port conflicts

---

## 🎯 Final Outcome

* Successfully implemented a fully automated CI/CD pipeline
* Enabled automatic build and deployment on every code push
* Reduced manual intervention and deployment errors
* Achieved consistent and reliable application delivery using Docker
* Deployed a live Node.js application on AWS EC2 with continuous updates
